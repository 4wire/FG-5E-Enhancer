# FG-Combat-Enhancer-5E

A community extension I'm writing to improve D&D 5E combat in Fantasy Grounds Unity.

**This document is not finalized, it is in draft form.**

## Design Goal
A minimalist streamlined version of the original Combat Enhancer, written for Fantasy Grounds Unity.

## Roadmap
- Horizontal Health Bars, with toggle setting in menu 
- Highlight of selected token for GM, underlay, with opacity settings in menu 
- Drag and drop conditions on targets in CT or tokens on map, if already on target then remove, otherwise add
